#  Javi the Coder

**Javi the Coder** is an interactive 2D educational game based on the children’s book you wrote of the same name.  
The game introduces young players to the world of **coding and logic** through play, imagination, and storytelling.

## Concept
Players guide a friendly robot named **Javi** by giving it simple **English commands** such as *move*, *turn*, and *pick up*.  
Each action helps Javi explore different scenes, complete small tasks, and build stories through code-like instructions.  

## Goals
- Teach children the basics of logic, sequencing, and cause-and-effect.  
- Encourage problem-solving and creative thinking.  
- Support early English learning through command-based gameplay.  

## Gameplay
Each scene presents a mini story or challenge.  
Children choose or type short commands to guide Javi and see immediate results on screen.  
Success is measured by curiosity and discovery — not by winning or losing.  

## Vision
Every programming language will one day have its own themed version and story,  
allowing kids to explore coding concepts through fun, narrative-driven worlds.
